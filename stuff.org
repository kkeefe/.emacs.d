all stuff below is inspired mostly from the following:

* todo sections
** todo stuff! ;)

 - shift - meta - enter : create an additional todo item
 - ctr -c / ctr - t : cycle through the states
 - ctr -c / ctr - d : bring up a calander in the editor..
 - ctr -c / ctr - a : summon the agenda options
 - M - shft - enter     : enter another TODO
 - when finishing and item / can append all 'done' items to single done.org archive..

  - create a date and you can easily cycle through with shift..
    DEADLINE: <2018-06-24 Sun>

 Aaron Bieber youtube video inspired:
 evil mode: or, how i learned to stop worrying and love emacs..
 [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWD1Fpdd4Pc][evil_mode!]]
*** gtags? 
    is this the ability to create links between functions between different files?
*** snippets - holy moly.. -- vscode like peek function definitions
*** emacsclient -t . 
    run a client emulator within your terminal to find your emacs client?
    tmux replacement?
*** helm? narrowing list prompts
    - narrowing completion framework - like ctrl - p for every emacs list.
    - search for a function name. etc
    - 'elisp advice' ?

* editing sections
** markup language stuff

 basic examples of text:
 +strikethrough+ /italic/ *bold* *anything* =verbatim= 


*** basic included stuff 

 - meta enter to create new tabs of the same type!
 - links
 - bullets

*** link stuff

 good key bindings to know:
 - ctr-c / ctr-l create a link
 - ctr-c / ctr-o (to go)

 - example link:
 - [[http://google.com][google!]]

 links can bring you to any place! emails, other files, to-do items.. or websites..
 
** tables!

 syntax :  | header 1 | header 2 |

          \|- (tab)

 these bad boys are spreadsheets. you can do almost anything you want inside of these data tables..
*** example
 | some            | data               |
 |-----------------+--------------------|
 | things you liek | we can format this |
 | literally       | hower we want..    |

 | header1 | header2 | header 3 | header 4 |
 |---------+---------+----------+----------|
 | stuff   | things  |      123 | 12F      |
 
** export to other fromats! :D 
 big installation for Tex =/ maybe overleaf is just better
 *Main command* : ctr -c / ctr -e 
*** html file! holy god!!

*** lets include some meta data

 #+TITLE: A Gentle Introduction to Org-mode! ;)

*** do you like doing whatever you want with your export? 
 #+OPTIONS: toc:nil
* org capture -emacs nyc --check it out
* export sections
** Source code: :D

 this puppy needs an org-babel install? to be able to run some of the source code you want..
 #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
   # comments to include here! :D
      def fact(n)
	if n == 0
	  1
	else
	  n* fact(n -1 )
	end
      end
 #+END_SRC

 #+BEGIN_SRC C++
   int a(1);
   int b(2);
   cout << "hi there.. " << endl;
   return a + b;
 #+END_SRC

** LaTeX Integration
*** formating things

 - bullets: \alpha \rightarrow \beta
 - $0(n * \log n)$

 \begin{align*}
  3 * 2 + &= 6 + 1 \\
          &= 7
 \end{align*}

** literate programming
